This is my looking forward statement. 

In my looking forward section, I plan on talking about how I plan on advancing my coding skills, as I found this skill very interesting throughout the year. Through this class and other classes I've taken, coding seems to be a very important skill in relations with technology. Many important people who have started billion dollar companies have an understanding with coding, and I believe that it would be very beneficial if I became comfortable with it as well. My three concrete steps I plan on doing to achieve this is: I will take classes that increase my knowledge on coding, I will apply my knowledge through coding workshops offered at Penn and in Philly, and I will try and get connections with other coders to learn more about it.

My first step is trying to find more classes at Penn, or maybe even online classes. This class has shown me how important it is to understand the code behind data and websites, and I think if I look into what classes Penn has to offer for this I could learn a lot. If not, online classes or lectures are always available to me, and I will take advantage of those classes. 

My second step is trying to apply what I have learned into real life, such as going to workshops and participating in coding projects offered to me either at Penn or in Philly. I will research where to find these things so I can apply what I have learned and practice, as if you practice a skill enough you will inevitably get better at it.

And lastly, I will use my social skills to try and make connections with advanced coders to help and guide me along my journey. They obviously have more knowledge than I do, and I think it would be very beneficial in becoming exposed to this in order for me to improve this skill set. I will reach out through linkedin or I will ask Professor Trettien to expose me to these people, as the connections that I already have can set me up with connections that they have. 

I look forward to pursue this skill in my future, and am very grateful I got exposed to this throughout my semester learning about digital humanities.
