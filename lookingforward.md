#Looking Forward

Statement where I discuss a brief statement outlining three concrete steps that you’ll take after this class to bring some of the work we’ve done together into your future learning. Maybe you want to follow up on learning a future skill; research how you might do that and name the steps you want to take in this statement. What classes will you take next? What books do you want to read? Who are your people, and how will you find them?
