My Jounrey Through Digital Humanities

Multiple themes and topics emerged throughout this semester surrounding digital humanities. To begin, we focused on the background of digital humanities to form an understanding of what they are. We discussed the archives, and how these types of data can be preserved to educate future generations about our past, and even our future. To extend on this, my workshop I attended in Philly I made a cassette tape of my favorite songs. In this workshop, I created an archive for myself that will hold onto a part of my history for the future. This process reminded me of the Dorethy Berry reading “The House the Archives Built”, and how this small piece of technology can become an archive for our future. This workshop related directly to what we are doing in class, especially our visit to Van Pelt where we looked at the immense amount of archives Penn has to offer. During this trip, I experienced a part of our past I never knew was there, and in that moment I realized how important the archives are, and how my cassette tape is part of that importance for generations to come.

As we got deeper into the semester, we started to look into datasets,  but diving deeper, we looked into the metadata of those data sets. We started to really dive deep into complicated pieces of data, such as The Umpire, after we visited Eastern State Penitentiary. During our visit here, I experienced how terrible it must have been to be a prisoner here, and I tried my best to put myself into the inmates shoes as I was walking across the prison. I eventually created my Printing in Prisons website surrounding this theme. I specifically looked into a specific inmate's case, and tried to humanize him and to understand him. Because of the metadata and the constant research I had to do in order to find enough information, I figured out many important aspects of my inmates life, and how he acted during his time at Eastern State.

Similar to this, my EC project was surrounded by the same idea; trying to humanize inmates for the audience/users of our project. The goal was to create a piece of art that fostered empathy and connection between the prisoners' experience and our viewers. Through looking into the metadata of The Umpire, I noticed a pattern that things aren't always as they seem, and looking into something more is crucial before you take action on it. This pattern I picked up after the class was over, and would have never picked it up in the middle of the semester. Coming into this class, I had no knowledge of the digital humanities. Obviously I knew it had to do with technology and was human focused, but nothing else. Flash forward three months, I know a lot more about it. Digital humanities is a very complex subject, but is very relevant and important in today's world. Through the advancement of technology, we can study humanistic subjects, especially human history like we did throughout the semester. On top of this, I became interested in this exact thing, how technology can further the study of humanistic subjects, and that's why I attended GIS day in Van Pelt for my workshop at Penn. Here I learned how Geographic systems help humans to decipher where things can go in cities, as they help them to achieve whatever goals they are aiming for. It interests me how much technology can help humans in whatever field they want to pursue. As we looked at the data from The Umpire, we figured out exactly what we wanted to study by looking into its metadata. GIS day exposed me to the same theme and how these Geographic systems attend to help humans to achieve great things for future generations.

Reflecting back over my own work this semester, I can confidently say I am proud of myself for achieving the things I did. Before this class, I never coded a single thing, let alone look into complicated data sets and create an essay from it. I was very proud of my metadata essay as I thought it captured important aspects from The Umpire. I also thought my EC project was done very well, and I thought my group and I had an amazing piece of work that we created through The Umpire. I honestly tried really hard in this class, and I think my work reflects that. For the essay, I wish I spent more time reviewing my grammar and synthesizing course themes better, but I thought my ideas throughout my work were complex and original. If I had a chance to revise all of my work, I wouldn't change much besides grammar mistakes, and try to synthesize the themes of the class with my work better, as I didn't do a great job on this during my reflection of my workshop in Philly. All in all, the themes throughout this course circulated from day one. From the archives and how important they are to humans right now, to metadata and how important it is to look deeper into data showed me how important and relevant the digital humanities are today,and for future generations to come. With the advancement of technology, and the growing field of human studies, I have hope that humans will continue to achieve great things, and the digital humanities will be an important part of this journey.
